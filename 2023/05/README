part 2 -- used a coarse grid spacing of 100 to get close to 
starting seed.  then made input2 to just search around this value.

not very elegant but it works because the ranges for each map transform 
are all more than like 10,000.  the chances of us hitting an edge are 
therefore small... I think.

its not very smart but it gives the right answer.
